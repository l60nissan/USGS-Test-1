# restoration_runs

## Overview

restoration_runs is a library of R-language scripts used to summarize/post-process output of Joint Ecosystem Modeling (JEM; https://jem.gov/) models used in restoration planning for projects such as the Lake Okeechobee System Operating Manual (LOSOM) and the Western Everglades Restoration Project (WERP). The scripts summarize model output and create figures and maps for each model.

*process_functions* scripts contain functions that summarize all the data, write it out, and create bar graphs

*maps_functions* scripts contain functions that create maps from the summarized data

*workflow* scripts source the above scripts to create all outputs

*run* scripts source scripts to run full workflow to process model output for each species model

**This repository can post-process model output from the following JEM models:**

[*Alligator Production Suitability Index Model (APSI) (American Alligator)*](https://jem.gov/Modeling/Alligator) 

[*EverSnail (native Florida apple snail)*](https://jem.gov/Modeling/EverSnail) 

[*Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow (CSSS) Marl Prairie Indicator*](https://jem.gov/Modeling/MarlPrairie)

[*Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow (CSSS) Helper*](https://jem.gov/Modeling/SparrowHelper)

[*Days Since Dry* (extracted from WADEM)](https://jem.gov/Modeling/WADEM)
Note: this repository does not process WADEM wading bird output.

[*Small Fish Density Model*](https://jem.gov/Modeling/SmallFishDensity) 

[*KiteNest (Everglades snail kite)*](https://jem.gov/Modeling/KiteNest) 

[*EverWaders (wading birds)*](https://jem.gov/Modeling/EverWaders) 

### A note about "provisional" and "approved" USGS GitLab repositories

The official USGS-approved GitLab release is available on the [XXX tag](url goes here). Because it is USGS-approved, it cannot be modified or edited, even to fix typos or bugs. Therefore, all bug fixes, edits, and additional development takes place on the [master branch](https://code.usgs.gov/warc/jem/models/restoration_runs), which is a provisional release. For the most up-to-date version, please navigate to the `master` branch if you haven't already.

## Descriptions of R scripts:

### Universal - scripts used in workflow for all models
*Sourced:*
* `workflow_packages.R` Checks to see if the necessary packages are install and installs any missing packages
* `workflow_inputs.R` Inputs set by the user to process model outputs for specific restoration run
* `species_string_definitions.R` Definitions of species string used in file paths - this might be a string in a parent folder and not the specific NetCDF file. For example, the alligator model output is saved to the folder named JEM_Alligator_Production_Probability_Model_Data and the output NetCDF is named Output.nc
* `shapefile_paths.R` Paths to shapefiles that are needed to process and map model output
* `process_definitions.R` Definition of process criteria for model outputs including: target years, breaks and labels for mapped data, titles for maps and figures, variable name in NetCDF. These default to the definitions used for LOSOM, but can be updated by the user if necessary for other restoration runs.

*SessionInfo()*
* `session_info.R` contains sessionInfo() from R session used to generate workflow

### Sparrow Helper
*sourced:*
* `sparrow_helper_table.R` Process Sparrow Helper model output and generate table. Write table to csv
* `sparrow_helper_plots.R` Process Sparrow Helper model output and generates bar plot

*run:*
* `run_sparrowhelper.R` Run full workflow to process Sparrow Helper model output

### Small Fish
*sourced:*
* `smallfish_map_functions.R` Functions to generate Small Fish maps
* `smallfish_barplot_functions.R` Functions to generate Small Fish bar plot
* `smallfill_workflow.R` Workflow that sources dependency functions, pulls in model output that needs processing, and generates processed model outputs

*run:*
* `run_smallfish.R` Run full workflow to process Small Fish model output

### NetCDF model output: Alligator, EverSnail, EverWaders, KiteNest, Days Since Dry
*sourced:*
* `rest_run_process_functions.R` Functions to process restoration run output that is in NetCDF format. Does not work to process WADEM.
* `rest_run_map_functions.R` Functions to generate maps for model output that is in NetCDF format
* `rest_run_workflow.R` Workflow that sources dependency functions, pulls in model output that needs processing and generates maps, bar plots, and acreage calculations

*run:*
* `run_kitenest.R` Run full workflow to process KiteNest
* `run_everwaders.R` Run full workflow to process EverWaders
* `run_dayssincedry.R` Run full workflow to process DaysSinceDry
* `run_applesnail.R` Run full workflow to process AppleSnail
* `run_alligator.R` Run full workflow to process Alligator

### Marl Prairie
*sourced:*
* `marlprairie_process_function.R` Functions to process Marl Prairie model outputs
* `marlprairie_map_function.R` Functions to generate maps for Marl Prairie model output
* `marlprairie_workflow.R` Workflow that sources dependency functions, pulls in model output, and generates maps and acreage calculations

*run:*
* `run_marlprairie.R` Run full workflow to process Marl Prairie 

## Steps to Process Species Model Output
The following steps describe steps to post-process JEM model output. For instructions to run individual JEM models please follow the links provided for each model in the repository "Overview".

1. Download repository - this download will include processing scripts, GIS files, and empty directory of folders necessary to run the workflow

2. Change R working directory to this `restoration_runs` directory. This will ensure all file paths are relative to this repository.

3. If processing COP or LOSOM model output skip to step 4. For restoration projects other than COP or LOSOM:
     - navigate to the associated [ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/) release
     - download the appropriate area of interest (AOI) shapefile
     - place AOI shapefile in the `GIS` directory

4. Place output from each JEM species model in the associated species sub folder within the `Data` folder

5. Open `workflow_inputs.R` and set/review the following inputs:
     - define `alt_names` (line 22) and `base_names` (line 27) as described in script (line 13-19)
     - set AOI shapefile path (line 98). This will only need to updated for projects other than COP or LOSOM. For other projects, this should point to the file downloaded in step 3.
     - set if mapped output should be landscape or portrait (line 107) as described in script (line 101-105) 

6. Execute the `run` script for the target species model. For example, run `run_alligator.R` to process alligator model output. There is no specified species model order that must be followed when running each `run` file. 

7. Find processed model output in the associated species sub folder within the `Output` folder.
